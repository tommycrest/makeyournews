- gReader [1]
- RSS Reader by Svyatoslav Vasilov [2]
- News Reader [3]
- InoReader [4]
- Tiny Tiny Reader [1]

If I compare my application idea to this similar existing application I see the same or something similar feature which
will offer my idea. 

In particular in this first alfa -> beta version of my application idea I will not include weather forecast that for 
sure are present on application [3].

All similar application [1,2,3,4,5] offer a service that permit to disambiguate read message from not read message. 
In this first release my application idea not offer a disambiguation like this but offer a simple news feeder.

Application [1,2,3,4] offer a particular cross-device authentication policy, to registered user on different can I share
the same item and the same configuration. Differently my application idea limit this to only to the application configuration
information, I mean languages choose for reading information and source if specify by the user.

The application [2] offer a chached version for offline reading on images in this first version of my application idea the
offline cached images will be not considered as a primary issue but with a low level of priority.
